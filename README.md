# React Router Dom v6 Routes Not Working After Adding New Route

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with React Router Dom v6. After adding a new route, existing routes stop working, and there are no console errors to indicate the problem. 

## Problem

The initial `App.js` file contains basic routes. After adding a new route, the application fails to render any of the routes correctly.  The console shows no errors, making debugging difficult.

## Solution

The issue is resolved in `AppSolution.js`.  Ensure that each Route has its own unique path and that your routes are well-structured and without conflicts.
